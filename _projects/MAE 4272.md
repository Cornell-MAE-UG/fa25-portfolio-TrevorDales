## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to design a blade optimized for realistic operating conditions by accounting for the statistical distribution of inflow speeds rather than a single design point. Using a Weibull distribution to model the probability of different wind speeds, the problem was to determine blade geometry that maximizes expected performance across the full operating range while remaining within structural and operational constraints. This required modeling and testing aerodynamic performance over the wind speed distribution to identify a blade design that performs robustly under variable, real-world conditions instead of being tuned to an idealized constant inflow.


## Design Approach

To design a blade, my group began by selecting some key geometric features to shrink the design space to a more managable size. This included choosing the maximum span and chord length (at the base) allowable, as these would create the most lift and therefore power. We then used a blade element approach to find the ideal pitch angle at each section, and to model the aerodynamic forces at each cross section of the blade. Using these forces, we could calculate the bending stress applied to the blade; we then sized the tip of our blade to be as big as possible without risking fracture at the base.

## Testing

To test the blade, we constructed a wind turbine using our 3D printed geometry. We then tested the blade at fixed wind speeds within the given environmental distribution, while measuring the RPM and applying a known torque. Repeating this method across wind speeds gave us an idea of how our blade produced power across the expected environmental conditions.

## Results

We found that our blade's maximum power increased with a cubic relationship relative to wind speed, as we expected. However, we realized one possible place for improvement: the direction of our airfoils camber and pitch were in opposite directions, causing them to create forces working against each other. While the pitch of the blade still dominated the produced power, changing the direction of the airfoil camber would further increase our efficiency.

My contributions to the project were as follows:
- Developing a robust testing procedure that kept the blade within safe operating ranges while still collecting data in the regimes we wanted. This included analyzing the wind probability distribution to ensure we tested across all expected conditions.
- Analysing power curve results to understand how robust our blade was to changing operating conditions
- Narrowing initial design to fit constraints, allowing for more detailed analysis and finer design changes.
